## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational physicist tha uses geospatial data science for climate research at the University of Ariszona. Some highlights:

I use computer vision and AI algorithms to transform satellite data into meaningful physical observations that can be used for forecasting, some of my projects (with associated peer reviewed paper):

I pioneered a way to observe 3D winds from infared satellites through a computer vision algorithm that uses concepts from AI (e.g. loss function regularization) Code: [3d-amvs](https://github.com/aouyed/3d-amvs/). I also appeared in the [local tv](https://www.kold.com/2023/04/14/scientists-university-arizona-develop-new-way-measure-wind-improving-future-weather-forecasting/) news to talk about project and it also had a mention in the [world economic forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/04/this-algorithm-could-help-better-predict-extreme-weather-events/). 

I created a monthl.  Codes:

Currently looking for new job opportunities.
