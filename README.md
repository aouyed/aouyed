## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational physicist tha uses geospatial data science for climate research at the University of Ariszona. Some highlights:

I use computer vision and AI algorithms to transform satellite data into meaningful physical observations that can be used for forecasting, some of my projects (with associated peer reviewed paper):

I was able to retrieve the global distribution of 3D winds for the first time by processing infrared data from two low earth orbiting satellites by creating an innovative image processing algorithm that uses some techniques associated with AI like regularization in the loss function:

 I have also worked in monthly forecasting of US climate using  convulutional neural networks that treat weather data as images.  Codes:

Currently looking for new job opportunities.
